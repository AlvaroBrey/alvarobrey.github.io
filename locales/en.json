I enjoy trying new technologies and as a consequence I have a somewhat generalist background. However, most of my experience is in Android and DevOps tasks.",
      "automation": "As a developer, I am guided by the DRY principle and strongly dislike duplication of both code and work. Partly due to this, I am proactive about <b>automating</b> tasks and processes whenever I can.

      "opensource": "I am also an advocate for <b>open-source</b> software. A significant part of my career has been spent working on open-source projects, and I've pushed for open-sourcing code whenever that's not been the case. Additionally I publish most of my personal projects, and I'm comfortable working out in the open.",
