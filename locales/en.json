I usually learn the basics of any new tool quickly and find a reward in gradually building my proficiency in new skills.",

I apply this in my daily work as a developer, by authoring scripts and automations that help me and my colleagues focus on development. This extends into my projects and hobbies: I've published some <a href=\"https://github.com/alvarobrey\">repos</a> that mainly focus on making my life easier as a developer, regardless of the specific use case that they address. I've also dipped my toes into home automation: I am a <a href=\"https://www.home-assistant.io/\">Home Assistant</a> user and I'm slowly building my own particular smart home.",
